Am revisiting Crafting Digital History course, and reviewing the first module,
which is where I stopped last time. 

Alot of it familiar, which is good.
Refreshed myself with using the text editor and markdown, pandoc etc. 
And using the command line to create different formats. 

Currently looking at Git and Github, and will be making a repository in DH box, but 
I can do this on my own server, which I will look to doing perhaps.
